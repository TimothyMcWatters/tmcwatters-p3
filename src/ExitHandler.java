 * File Name: ExitHandler.java
 * 
 * This Program: Will create a graphical spell checker program
 * It will have a menu item to open an input file and place it into a TextArea in a window. 
 * When the checking proceeds, it will extract a word from the text to be checked, 
 * hash it into the table, and determine if it exists. 
 * You will continue this process until you have checked all the words in the file. 
 * Each time you find a word that you cannot match in the dictionary, you will let the user 
 * know and you will attempt to generate a list of suggested words. 
 * You will generate the list by assembling similar words via three methods:
 *		One letter missing. 
 *		One letter added. 
 *		Two letters reversed.
